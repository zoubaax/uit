-- Disable public signups in Supabase Auth
-- This should be done via Supabase Dashboard: Authentication > Settings > Auth Providers > Email
-- But we can also set it programmatically if needed

-- Note: To disable registration in Supabase Dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Authentication > Settings
-- 2. Under "Auth Providers" > "Email"
-- 3. Toggle OFF "Enable email signup"
-- 4. Save changes

-- Alternatively, you can use the Supabase Management API to disable signups
-- This SQL file serves as documentation that registration should be disabled
